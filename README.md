# GLRenderEngine

## Description
Rendering engine written in C++ using the OpenGL graphics API. It offers a range of advanced rendering techniques,
including deferred shading, Physically-Based Rendering (PBR), Image-Based Lighting (IBL), support for loading 3D
models and post-processing.
It uses GLFW and GLAD for managing OpenGL, ASSIMP for model loading, SOIL2 for loading 2D images, STB_IMAGE for loading HDRIs

## Installation
You can just install it but unfortunately for some, the project is still in development so I don't plan on making
installation easy. If it is useful for you, this project is made in Visual Studio Community 2023.

## Credits
I want to give credit to Joey DeVries, the author of 'LearnOpenGL,' for creating such a masterpiece that helped many in their journey in computer graphics.
