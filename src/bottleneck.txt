My Benchmark:
	->initLibs and initOGL together took ~100ms
	->Shader loading part took ~500ms
	->initPBRVariables took ~285ms
	->loading the pbrGun took ~850ms
	->loading the pbrGun material took ~1538ms (every texture takes ~250ms)
		->stbi_load took ~200ms(THIS IS BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF THE TEXTURES)
		->glTexImage2D took ~50ms
Setting uniforms for all 3 shaders takes around 1.1ms
